# Random Dot Motion Task

This experiment presents moving-dot at different coherence levels and directions. Participants should indicate motion direction using arrow keys.

#Modified Places:
I changed the 'welcome' sentences into green color. And the original moving direction is 0 and 180, while the new moving direction is 0 and 90. If the direction is 90, press 'left' key and vice versa.
